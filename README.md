**Learning Survival Distributions with Individually Calibrated Asymmetric Laplace Distribution** 📄

## 🔍 Overview
Survival analysis plays a critical role in modeling time-to-event outcomes across various domains. 
Although recent advances have focused on improving *predictive accuracy* and *concordance*, fine-grained *calibration* remains comparatively underexplored. 
In this paper, we propose a survival modeling framework based on the Individually Calibrated Asymmetric Laplace Distribution (ICALD), which unifies *parametric* and *nonparametric* approaches based on the ALD.
We begin by revisiting the probabilistic foundation of the widely used *pinball* loss in *quantile regression* and its reparameterization as the *asymmetry form* of the ALD. 
This reparameterization enables a principled shift to *parametric* modeling while preserving the flexibility of *nonparametric* methods.
Furthermore, we show theoretically that ICALD, with the *quantile regression* loss is probably approximately individually calibrated.
Then we design an extended ICALD framework that supports both *pre-calibration* and *post-calibration* strategies. 
Extensive experiments on 14 synthetic and 7 real-world datasets demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance in terms of *predictive accuracy*, *concordance*, and *calibration*, while outperforming 12 existing baselines including recent *pre-calibration* and *post-calibration* methods.
